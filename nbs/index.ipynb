    "\n",
    "> Welcome to the nbdev tutorial! nbdev is a powerful tool for developing Python libraries entirely in Jupyter notebooks. With nbdev, you can write code, create documentation, run tests, and build your library, all within a notebook environment. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using nbdev to create your own Python library."

    "\n",
    "> - `Notebook-Driven Development`: Write your code and documentation in Jupyter notebooks, enabling an interactive and iterative development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `Automated Documentation`: Generate high-quality documentation automatically from your notebooks using tools like Quarto and GitHub Pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `Testing and Continuous Integration`: Write tests directly in your notebooks, and run them automatically to ensure your code is working correctly. nbdev integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `Package Building`: Build your library into a distributable Python package with a single command, making it easy to share and distribute your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - `Git Integration`: nbdev provides Git hooks that clean unwanted metadata and render merge conflicts in a human-readable format, making version control and collaboration easier."
